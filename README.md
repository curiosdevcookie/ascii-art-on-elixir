# Elixir goes ASCII Art Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

This is a repo to play around with ASCII and elixir.

The aim is to create different patterns in your terminal that are made up of characters from a given string, in our case _Elixir_.

## The heart shape

### How to run

1. Clone the repo.
2. In your terminal, run:

```zsh
elixir we_love.exs
```

3. Enjoy playing around with it ðŸ˜ƒ

## Breakdown of the code

 The definition of the module `WeLove` contains the module attribute `love`, and the functions `character_at`, `math_power`, and `patch_together`.

 The code is split into 5 parts:

1. The module attribute `love` stores the string "Elixir ", chopped into its chars. (â€¦ of course, you can change the value to whatever you want, however, paying homage to our beloved Elixir lang seemed kinda fitting to start with ðŸ™ƒ)

2. The function `character_at` calculates the index of the character in the @love string using the modulo operator (which returns the remainder of the division of its first argument by its second argument) and the length of the string.

3. The function `math_power` takes two arguments, x and y, and returns a boolean, indicating whether the point (x, y) is inside the heart shape or not.

* This is the basic mathematical formula for our heart: ((x)Â² + (y)^2 - 1)Â³ - (x)Â² * (y)Â³ <= 0
* The ((x)Â² + (y)Â² - 1)Â³ part describes a circle, the (x)Â² * (y)Â³ part descibes a cube.
* Subtract the (x)Â² * (y)Â³ part from the ((x)Â² + (y)Â² - 1)Â³ part and less-than-or-equal it to 0 to get the shape of a heart.
* To play around with this math part, visit: <https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=++%28%28x+*+0.05%29%5E2+%2B+%28y+*+0.1%29%5E2+-+1%29%5E3+-+%28x+*+0.05%29%5E2+*+%28y+*+0.1%29%5E3+%3C%3D+0>

4. The function `patch_together` is the main function that creates the heart shape. It does so by:

* maps over a range of y values, and for each y value, again maps over a range of x values in order to create a row of characters for that specific y value.

* joins the characters in each of those rows to form a string.

* reverses the order of all the rows to make the heart point upwards.

* joins all the rows with a newline character to form the complete heart shape.

5. The last section of the code calls the `patch_together` function and prints the result to the terminal.

## The easter egg

### How to run

1. Clone the repo.
2. In your terminal, run:

```zsh
elixir easter_egg.exs
```

3. Enjoy playing around with it ðŸ˜ƒ

## Breakdown of the code

 The definition of the module `EasterEgg` contains the module attribute `egg`, and the functions `character_at`,  `math_power`, and `patch_together`.

 The code is split into 5 parts:

1. The module attribute `egg` stores the string "Elixir ", chopped into its chars. (â€¦ of course, you can change the value to whatever you want, however, paying homage to our beloved Elixir lang seemed kinda fitting to start with ðŸ™ƒ)

2. The function `character_at` calculates the index of the character in the @egg string using the modulo operator (which returns the remainder of the division of its first argument by its second argument) and the length of the string.

3. The function `math_power` takes two arguments, x and y, and returns a boolean, indicating whether the point (x, y) is inside the egg shape or not.

*  It's based on the mathematical formula for an ellipse xÂ²/bÂ² + yÂ²/aÂ² = 1
* We stitch together two ellipses to form an egg shape, depending on whether y > 0. For values meeting that condition, the shape gets broader, and for values not meeting that condition, the shape gets narrower.

* To play around with this math part, visit: <https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%28y%2F2.5%29Â²+%2B+%28x%2F2%29Â²+%3D+1>

* maps over a range of y values, and for each y value, again maps over a range of x values in order to create a row of characters for that specific y value.

* joins the characters in each of those rows to form a string.

* reverses the order of all the rows to make the egg point upwards.
